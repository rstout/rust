- Tokens don't have branching (e.g. <|>)
- can have token "literls", e.g. using the parsing API we can do:
    -> hex = symbol("0") ->> oneOf("xX") ->> digit*
- want to capture values
    -> digit* should return the string of digits it parses
- user and lib error messages, need line and column info
    -> use while loop instead of "for x in iter" so we can backtrack
- start simple, by parsing just decimals and additions
- Token, Lexer, Parser
- Token fns - oneOf, inRange, not (!)
- Parse fns - option/maybe (?), many (*), many1 (+)
- Success, Failure, Error

- Token: list of accepting states? ADT for types of accepting states
  (range vs list)
- Separate what goes in parser and what goes in Lex/Token
- Token should be a single char
    -> for now, to make it easier

- What is a token?
- ADTs
- Tokens are a chain of accepting states
- We get a char of input. What next?
- Lexer is DFA with chars -> tokens, Parser is DFA with tokens -> AST
- Rounds: first round, get rid of tokens that don't match first char.
  Second round get rid of tokens that don't continue to match with second
  input char, and so on
- Token type should not be an ADT?
- matchAndConsume, then filter on those that matched
    -> repeat until in terminal state and next char doesn't match
- Have reserved keywords be tokens?
    -> No
- Comments
- parse :: FilePath -> AST
- Consume: function that returns a function
    -> like the that Go lib
- Difference between tokens vs token directives
    -> token::Plus vs the function used to define the token (e.g.
       symbol("+"), or lit_char('+'))
- Is Tokenizing/Lexing ambiguous? i.e. can the same input tokenize as 2
  different tokens? Like, is this a case that will come up?
    -> I don't think it is
- Have to keep state
    -> When tokenizing an identifier, need to return the entire string
       identifier
    -> So token objects need a payload/str field
- The list of Tokens that we give to the tokenizer have type <T: Token>
    -> i.e. they implement the Token interface
- Think typeclasses
- Tokenizer/Lexer has function called Tokenize/Lex that takes in a list (?)
  of elements of type <T: Token>
    -> or maybe returns such a list?
- Token can contain its parsing directive
- How do we make the API simple? What would we like to do, and how would we
  like to do it?
    -> Do this (skeleton code)
- Token creators are symbol("c"), digit.+(), etc
    -> they return Tokens
- Tokens could be type parameterized with a user Token type
- Have to map token directive to user token type(s)
- Could map TD to fn: ~str -> <T>, where T is user token type
- LexCmd = TokenDirective
- for _ in enum { try to match, get list of matching tokens (filter), and
  try to continue to match }
- Implement a trait for you token type
    -> Want the other way around though (don't want MyTokenType to map to
       LexCmds, want LexCmds to map to Tokens)
    -> We are trying to contruct tokens
- In parser user code, need to be able to specify strings
    -> e.g. ident("if")
- Maybe do ident(Option<~str>)?
    -> No, there should be a better way
    -> Want behvior completely user defined
- Issue: how does the user use their tokens in the parsing API?
    -> Problem with constructors: The user wants to specify ident, not
       ident(str)
    -> maybe ident shouldn't be a token?
    -> How do we use tokens with constructors in the Parse API?
- Maybe Tokens shouldn't have constructors, but should be instead be a field
  in a struct, with payload another field in the stuct
    ->  stuct Token<T> {
            type: T; // This is the user token type
            payload: ~str;
        }
    -> makeToken<T>(myToken: T) -> Token<T>
        -> Or just have a constructor for Token (Token<T>::new(MyToken))
    -> This is more flexible
- Use the std::ops traits to overwrite +,-,!, etc.
- DFA should be a (generic) trait, and LexCmd should implement that trait
    -> User should see LexCmd in the API instead of DFA
- Lexer will take a list of tokens, extract all the lexcmds and make one big
  lexcmd (?)
- For LexCmds, implement the SHL trait (>>), so that we can chain lexCmds
  like: hex = symbol("0") >> oneOf(["X", "x"]) >> many1(digit)
- Can also implement the ! trait for negation of a LexCmd (useful for oneOf)
- Tokens are what the Lexer should be giving the user
    -> Input to the Lexer is (map: LexCmd -> <T>)
    -> Output is Token<T>
